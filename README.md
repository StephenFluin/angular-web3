# 🏄‍♂️ Quick Start

Prerequisites: [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) plus [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/) or [Npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

### 1) Add the angularonchain schematics package to your project  

```bash
ng add angularonchain
```
  &nbsp;  
### 2) Choose installation Options:
The package will prompt the options for configuration  
- Project name: if not provided, the angular,json default project will be taken
- Demo Dapp to be installed. The roadmap shows the plan to add additional demo Dapps, for the time being only "Hello on Chan
  - Hello On Chain Dapp

 &nbsp;  



```bash
npm run 
```
   &nbsp;  
### 2) install and start your 👷‍ Hardhat chain:

```bash
npm run 
```


🔏 Edit your smart contract `.sol` in `hagreeterrdhat/contracts`


💼 Edit your deployment scripts in `/hardhat/deploy`
