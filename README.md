# ⛓️  AngularOnChain

Thaks to  @austingriffit for crafting the awesome [Scaffold-eth](https://github.com/scaffold-eth/scaffold-eth) project. This projects aims to reproduce with angular tooling the same experience as scaffold-sth produce for react devs

## Vision

Superpower the angular superdevs with the best and easy to use tools for get up and running instantly creating wonderfull dapps on Ethereum/polygon's blockchains

### Mision

> everything you need to build on Ethereum and Polygon! 🚀.

🧪 Quickly experiment with Solidity using a frontend that adapts to your smart contract:

# ROADMAP

10/01/22 First release npm package with min config

15/01/22 Release npm package with contract interaction

...

01/03/2022 Complete reproduction scaffold-eth as angular schemartics  

 &nbsp; 


# 🏄‍♂️ Quick Start

Prerequisites: [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) plus [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

> add @angularonchain schematics 

```bash
ng add @angularonchain/install 
```

> install and start your 👷‍ Hardhat chain:

```bash
npm run 
```


🔏 Edit your smart contract `.sol` in `hagreeterrdhat/contracts`


💼 Edit your deployment scripts in `/hardhat/deploy`
